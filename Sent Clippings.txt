Every time you get a strong impulse to talk about meditation and how wonderful it is, or how hard it is, or what its doing for you these days, or what its not, or you want to convince someone else how wonderful it would be for them, just look at it as more thinking and go meditate some more. The impulse will pass and everybody will be better offespecially you.

Rhetoric is an agnostic art; it requires more adaptation than righteousness. You adapt to the values of your audience. Values take on a different meaning in rhetoric as well. Rhetorical values do not necessarily represent rightness or truth; they merely constitute what people valuehonor, faith, steadfastness, money, toys. Support your audiences values, and you earn the temporary trustworthiness that rhetoric calls virtue. Among the ways to pump up your rhetorical virtue, we covered four: Brag. Get a witness to brag for you. Reveal a tactical flaw. Switch sides when the powers that be do. A variation is the Eddie Haskell Ploy, which throws your support behind the inevitable. When you know you will lose, preempt your opponent by taking his side

But it simultaneously teaches us to prepare ourselves for changes that will deprive us of the things that delight us. It teaches us, in other words, to enjoy what we have without clinging to it.

On the basis of these investigations, the Stoics produced a body of advice for anyone seeking tranquility. Among their recommendations were the following:  We should become self-aware: We should observe ourselves as we go about our daily business, and we should periodically reflect on how we responded to the days events. How did we respond to an insult? To the loss of a possession? To a stressful situation? Did we, in our responses, put Stoic psychological strategies to work?  We should use our reasoning ability to overcome negative emotions. We should also use our reasoning ability to master our desires, to the extent that it is possible to do so. In particular, we should use reason to convince ourselves that things such as fame and fortune arent worth havingnot, at any rate, if what we seek is tranquilityand therefore arent worth pursuing. Likewise, we should use our reasoning ability to convince ourselves that even though certain activities are pleasurable, engaging in those activities will disrupt our tranquility, and the tranquility lost will outweigh the pleasure gained.  If, despite not having pursued wealth, we find ourselves wealthy, we should enjoy our affluence; it was the Cynics, not the Stoics, who advocated asceticism. But although we should enjoy wealth, we should not cling to it; indeed, even as we enjoy it, we should contemplate its loss.  We are social creatures; we will be miserable if we try to cut off contact with other people. Therefore, if what we seek is tranquility, we should form and maintain relations with others.
