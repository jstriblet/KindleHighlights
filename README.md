# Kindle Highlights

KindleHighlights is a small Node.js utility that will sends readers text highlights made on their Kindle by way of a shell script and a Launchd entry.

The hope for this project is to leverage spaced repetition to combat the forgetting curve by serving up randomly selected highlights from your Kindle Clippings -- Helping readers remember the content that resonated most.
